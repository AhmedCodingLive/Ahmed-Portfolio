 Thank you for reaching out! I am happy to assist.😊 
 
 I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I couldn't locate a paid account under the email address (ahmhuz2002@gmail.com (mailto:ahmhuz2002@gmail.com)). To assist you better, I would need more information about the charge you are inquiring about. Could you please share the following: 
 - The last 4 digits of the card 
- Card's expiration date 
- Date of the most recent charge 
- Charge amount 
 Should you have used PayPal for your transaction, could you please share the email address linked to your PayPal account? If you upgraded using the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, please share a copy of your confirmation email/receipt that they sent for this charge. Alternatively, I could search by using different email addresses or by your channel link. 
 
 Once I have this information, I'll do my best to locate your account. Thank you for your patience and understanding!🙏🏼💜
